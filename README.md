# WARVIS

### Currently, IBM Watson API allows you to work with audio files on your computer to implement Speech To Text.
### WARVIS works directly with your microphone and provides the functionality of IBM Watson TTS without having to store audio files of your voice recordings.
#### On top of that, WARVIS detects loudness levels when recording and waits patiently until you speak.

* You are able to customise the loudness threshold of your voice, so WARVIS knows when to start 'listening'
* You can also customise the number of seconds to wait after you finished speaking, so you are not interrupted when making pauses between sentences.

### Text To Speech has never been that easy. IBM Watson API only allows you to save generated voice as an audio file.

* Just type in the words that you would like your computer to 'say' and it will do it in a matter of seconds, without having to save an audio file of the generated voice.

## Instructions

* Go to IBM Cloud website, create credentials for TTS and STT (it's free!)
* Insert them into main.py
