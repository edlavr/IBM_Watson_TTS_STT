# IBM Watson TTS and STT using computer mic and speakers (no audio files) + enhancements!

### Currently, IBM Watson API only allows you to work with audio files on your computer to implement Speech To Text and Text to Speech.
### &#x1F535; Now you have WARVIS (Watson + JARVIS = ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯) &#x1F535;
### WARVIS works directly with your microphone and provides the functionality of IBM Watson TTS without having to store audio files of your voice recordings.

### &#x1F535; WARVIS detects loudness levels when recording and 'waits' until you start speaking &#x1F535;


* You are able to customise the loudness threshold of your voice, so WARVIS knows when to <i>start</i> 'listening'
* You can also change the number of seconds to wait after you <i>finish</i> speaking, so you are not interrupted when making pauses between sentences

### &#x1F535; Text To Speech has never been that easy. No audio files at all! &#x1F535;

* Just type in the words that you would like your computer to 'say' and it will do it in a matter of seconds, without having to save an audio file of the generated voice.

## Instructions

* Go to IBM Cloud website, create credentials for TTS and STT (it's free!)
* Insert them into main.py

#### WARNING
The program might take some time for the initial launch, please be patient!
